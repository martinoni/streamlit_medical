    "text": "Okay \u2013 well, I think the bottom line is, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything at the moment that we have to rush around and be concerned about.  Just age, I\u2019m just ageing.  Well no, you\u2019re a bit more interesting than that. I think as far as Dr Hall\u2019s bits and pieces and tests last time and I don\u2019t know how much she explained about all those tests and memory\u2026 I had a scan.   As far as the memory questions and everything that you did last time\u2026It\u2019s not an exam that you have to pass or fail, or whatever, but what it does, it just tends to pull out where any strengths or weaknesses are, but now, you have many, many more strengths than any weaknesses, so and to be honest, most people would be very happy with things. Because we\u2019re specifically looking for weaknesses, it was, as your husband says, it\u2019s new information\u2026  That is correct, short memory At this moment, the doctor moves between looking at the computer screen, which shows images from Mrs Johnson\u2019s CT scan and Mrs Johnson herself. He uses a pen as a pointer, to highlight parts of the scan he is describing.  Now these (pointing to the brain scan) are absolutely normal, they\u2019re the space in the middle of the brain, but obviously, this one on this side is much bigger than the one on that side and actually, what that is, is space, the black area. So what that implies is because that when \u2013 like any wound or scar \u2013 heals up, it contracts. So it\u2019s contracted so it\u2019s pulling that. So there is quite a big area of damage round there, but that\u2019s why Dr Hall last time, and why I\u2019m chatting this time, you clearly \u2013 that will have done it\u2019s damage, it heals up. Obviously you\u2019ve actually, on 90% functioning brain, you haven\u2019t really missed that 20% for the last 20 years.  No, that\u2019s fair comment.  Because it\u2019s \u2013 and you are very well planned, because that part of the brain tends to not be particularly specialised to any particular thing. This side of the brain is fine. By the way, you can probably compensate for it\u2026And so you \u2013 the rest of the brain has just taken over the work of that.  You\u2019ve been very lucky really.  So the relevance of it is the fact that \u2013 in a way, what it does mean is you have got less reserves than other brains would have, because for the last 20 years you\u2019ve been doing very well on 90% function rather than 100% function. Now what that does mean, I suppose, is if now we\u2019ve got something extra, which there must be, cause it\u2019s a recent change, well, you\u2019ve got less reserves than your husband would have or \u2013 in a way, I hate \u2013 I was going to say normal.  Normal, oh, I don\u2019t mind.  A normal person of your age would have. The two other things that the brain scan shows is that there is a bit of shrinkage of the brain over on this side which is well away from there. So just this area, it\u2019s opened, and there\u2019s a bit of shrinkage in that part of the brain. Now that can happen with age; that can happen with lots of things so\u2026And then the one other thing is there\u2019s this \u2013 not the black and not the light grey, but there\u2019s this darker grey rim around it. Now, that\u2019s the sort of appearance you get when the smaller blood vessels are a little bit clogged up, which, again, is something that happens with age. So the bottom line is, yes clearly, the memory for new things \u2013 your husband was saying short-term memory, I think I\u2019d probably talk more about learning new problems being an issue, isn\u2019t as strong as it should be. As far as the blood tests are concerned, they\u2019re all absolutely fine. As far as the scan is concerned, there\u2019s the big chunk which is there, and probably it\u2019s a combination of the fact that you\u2019ve got less reserves because of that and so this smaller blood vessel problems and maybe that bit of shrinkage around there, is enough to be causing the problems. If this were firing on 100% than just on 90%, it probably would be much less of an issue.   Let\u2019s be honest. You were concerned about Alzheimer\u2019s to be honest.  Yes. I did. I thought, \u2018Oh my gosh, have I got Alzheimer\u2019s?\u2019  That\u2019s what she was concerned about.  But there isn\u2019t Alzheimer\u2019s in the family, but then as I say, it\u2019s got to start somewhere, hasn\u2019t it?  Yeah, no, that\u2019s true and it\u2019s\u2026I think, as far as Alzheimer\u2019s is concerned, first of all it seems to have become a word\u2026Nobody had heard of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, but suddenly now it\u2019s become this dreadful word\u2026   Dementia it always used to be\u2026  That was it. At the moment you wouldn\u2019t fulfil any criteria for Alzheimer\u2019s Disease whatsoever.  Well, that\u2019ll make you happy.  So that\u2019s good. But there\u2019s always a but. [Laughter] Absolutely. But, first of all, I can\u2019t foretell the future. The other thing is that Alzheimer\u2019s Disease actually is quite common once you get into your seventies, eighties, but it progresses very, very slowly over eight, ten, twelve years. So I can\u2019t tell you if we look 10 years ahead\u2026 "
